	"Description" "A chamberlock entrance door, which is used to separate multiple test chambers in a single map. Has a built in fizzler and will close permanently behind the player. Can be used in conjunction with a Chamberlock Exit to create a proper chamberlock or simply placed on it's own, unlike the BEE2 chamberlock."
